Notes:
# objectives done:
1) Become familiar with ActiveRecord syntax for models and migrations.

2) Learn about ActiveRecord macros for creating associations between models.


--fail-fast doesn't work with this lab.

14/14
1) `uninitialized constant Song`
- create `models/song.rb`, define `Song` class

2) `Could not find table 'songs'`
- fill in migration for songs table (seems rake db:migrate is part of what happens when the spec is run, so no need to do that)

  def change
    create_table :songs do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
  end


14/13
3) `Could not find table 'artists'`
- fill in migration for artists table
  
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
  end


14/12
4) `Could not find table 'genres'`

  def change
    create_table :genres do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
  end


14/11
5) `undefined method `genre=' for #<Song id: 1, name: "Forever">`
- fill in migration to add genre to songs, add `belongs_to :genre` in Song class

class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :genre
end

class AddGenreToSongs < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :songs, :genre_id, :integer
  end
end


14/10
6) `undefined method `artist=' for #<Song id: 1, name: "Forever", genre_id: nil>`
- fill in migration to add artist to songs, add `belongs_to :artist` in Song class

class AddArtistToSongs < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :songs, :artist_id, :integer
  end
end

class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :genre
  belongs_to :artist
end


14/8
7) `undefined method `songs' for #<Genre id: 1, name: "Rap">`

  has_many :songs
end


14/6
8) `undefined method `songs' for #<Artist id: 1, name: "Prince">`

9) `undefined method `genres' for #<Artist id: 1, name: "Prince">`
- Add `has_many :genres, through: :songs` to Artist class

class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :songs
  has_many :genres, through: :songs
end


14/1
10) `undefined method `artists' for #<Genre id: 1, name: "Hip Hop">`
